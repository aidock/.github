The AiDock Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put AiDock’s values into practice. It’s built around the recognition that everything we do in connection with our work at AiDock will be, and should be, measured against the highest possible standards of ethical business conduct. We set the bar high for practical and aspirational reasons: Our commitment to the highest standards helps us hire great people, build great products, and attract loyal customers. Respect for our customers, for the opportunity, and each other are foundational to our success and are something we need to support every day.

So please read the Code and AiDock’s values and follow both in spirit and letter, always bearing in mind that each of us has a personal responsibility to incorporate the principles of the Code and values into our work. And if you have a question or think one of your colleagues or the company may be falling short of our commitment, don’t be silent. We want – and need – to hear from you.

## Who Must Follow Our Code?

We expect all our employees and Board members to know and follow the Code. Failure to do so can result in disciplinary action, including termination of employment. Moreover, while the Code is written for AiDock employees and Board members, we expect members of our extended workforce (temps, vendors, and independent contractors) and others who may be temporarily assigned to perform work or services for AiDock to follow the Code in connection with their work for us. Failure of a member of our extended workforce or another covered service provider to follow the Code can result in the termination of their relationship with AiDock.

### What If I Have a Code-Related Question or Concern?

If you have a question or concern, don’t just sit there. Contact your manager, Human Resources representative, or Ethics & Compliance. You can also submit a question or raise a concern about a suspected violation or if you believe a breach of law has occurred in our Code through the Ethics & Compliance reporting link ( [violation report](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfv_iISNALlXCneEAMiew9k02cEbRght9BPjICb8Hf94uRyWw/viewform?usp=pp_url) ). 

### **No Retaliation**

AiDock prohibits retaliation against any worker here at AiDock who reports or participates in an investigation of a possible violation of our Code, policies, or the law. If you believe you are being retaliated against, please report through Ethics & Compliance [violation report](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfv_iISNALlXCneEAMiew9k02cEbRght9BPjICb8Hf94uRyWw/viewform?usp=pp_url) 

## **Serve Our customers**

Our customers value AiDock because we deliver great products and services and because we hold ourselves to a higher standard in how we treat customers and operate more generally. Keeping the following principles in mind will help us to maintain that high standard:

1.  **Integrity**  
    Our reputation as a company that our customers can trust is our most valuable asset, and it is up to all of us to ensure that we continually earn that trust. Our communications and interactions with our customers should increase their confidence in us.
2.  **Usefulness**  
    Our products, features, and services should make AiDock more useful for all our customers. We have many different types of customers, from individuals to large businesses, but one guiding principle: “Is what we are offering useful?”
3.  **Privacy, Security, and Freedom of Expression**  
    Always remember that we ask customers to trust us with their information. Preserving that trust requires respecting and protecting that information’s privacy and security. Our security procedures strictly limit access to and use of customers’ information and demand that we take measures to protect user data from unauthorized access. Know your responsibilities under these procedures, and collect, use, and access user personal information only as authorized by our Security Policies, Privacy Policies, and applicable data protection laws.  
    AiDock is committed to advancing privacy and freedom of expression for our users worldwide. Where user privacy and freedom of expression face government challenges, we seek to implement internationally recognized standards that respect those rights as we develop products, do business in diverse markets, and respond to government requests to access user information or remove user content. Contact Legal or [Tomer Shamir](mailto:tomer@aidock.net) if you have questions about implementing these standards in connection with what you do at AiDock.
4.  **Responsiveness**  
    , Part of being helpful and honest, is being responsive: We recognize relevant customers' feedback when we see it and do something about it. We take pride in responding to communications from our customers, whether questions, problems, or compliments. If something is broken, fix it.
5.  **Take Action**  
    Any time you feel our customers aren’t being well-served, don’t be bashful - let someone in the company know about it. Continually improving our products and services takes all of us. We’re proud to take the initiative to step forward when the interests of our customers are at stake.

## **Support and Respect Each Other**

1.  **Our principles**  
    AiDock has an unwavering commitment to prohibiting and effectively responding to harassment, discrimination, misconduct, abusive conduct, and retaliation.  
    To that end, AiDock adheres to these Guiding Principles:  
    **Commitment:** AiDock sets a tone at the top of commitment to a respectful, safe, and inclusive working environment for all employees and members of the extended workforce.  
    **Care:** AiDock creates an environment emphasizing respect for each individual at all levels of the organization, specifically by offering assistance and showing empathy to employees and members of the extended workforce throughout and after the complaint process.  
    **Transparency:** AiDock is open and transparent regarding the frequency with which complaints arise regarding harassment, discrimination, misconduct, abusive conduct, and retaliation and the Company’s approach to investigating and responding to those allegations.  
    **Fairness & Consistency:** AiDock ensures that individuals are treated respectfully, fairly, and compassionately in all aspects of AiDock interactions and applies policies, procedures, and outcomes consistently, regardless of who is involved.  
    **Accountability:** AiDock holds all individuals responsible for their actions and ensures that those individuals hold others accountable, where appropriate too.
2.  **Our practice**  
    Consistent with the Principles, AiDock employees are expected to do their utmost to create a supportive work environment where everyone can reach their fullest potential and be free from harassment, intimidation, bias, and unlawful discrimination.

## **Equal Opportunity Employment**

Employment here is based solely upon individual merit and qualifications directly related to professional competence. We strictly prohibit unlawful discrimination or harassment based on race, color, religion, veteran status, national origin, ancestry, pregnancy status, sex, gender identity or expression, age, marital status, mental or physical disability, medical condition, sexual orientation, or any other characteristics protected by law. We also make all reasonable accommodations to meet our obligations under laws protecting the rights of people with disabilities.

1.  **Harassment, Discrimination, and Bullying**  
    AiDock prohibits discrimination, harassment, and bullying in any form – verbal, physical, or visual, as discussed more fully in our Policy Against Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation. Suppose you believe you’ve been bullied, harassed, or discriminated against by anyone at AiDock or an AiDock partner or vendor. In that case, we strongly encourage you to immediately report the incident to your supervisor, Human Resources, or both. Similarly, supervisors and managers who learn of any such incident should immediately report it to Human Resources. Human Resources will promptly and thoroughly investigate any complaints and take appropriate action.
2.  **Drugs and Alcohol**  
    Our position on substance abuse is simple: It is incompatible with the health and safety of our employees, and we don’t permit it. Consumption of alcohol is not banned at our offices, but use good judgment and never drink in a way that leads to impaired performance or inappropriate behavior, endangers the safety of others, or violates the law. Illegal drugs in our offices or at sponsored events are strictly prohibited. Suppose a manager has reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee’s use of drugs and alcohol may adversely affect the employee’s job performance or the safety of the employee or others in the workplace. Reasonable suspicion may be based on objective symptoms such as the employee’s appearance, behavior, or speech.
3.  **Safe and Healthy Workplace**  
    We are committed to a safe, healthy, and violence-free work environment. Behavior that risks the safety, health, or security of AiDock employees, our extended workforce, or visitors is prohibited. If you become aware of a threat to our workplace’s safety, health, or security, you should report it to   
    Tomer Shamir (+972-526542210).   
    If it is life-threatening or an emergency, call your local police, fire, or other emergency responders first, and then report it to Tomer Shamir (+972-526542210).

## **Avoid Conflicts of Interest**

When you are in a situation in which competing loyalties could cause you to pursue a personal benefit for you, your friends, or your family at the expense of AiDock or our customers, you may be faced with a conflict of interest. All of us should avoid conflicts of interest and circumstances that reasonably present the appearance of a match.

When considering a course of action, ask yourself whether the effort you’re considering could create an incentive for you or appear to others to create an incentive for you, to benefit yourself, your friends or family, or an associated business at the expense of AiDock. If the answer is “yes,” the action you’re considering is likely to create a conflict of interest situation, and you should avoid it.

Below, we guide in seven areas where conflicts of interest often arise:

*   Personal investments
*   Outside employment, advisory roles, board seats, and starting your own business
*   Business opportunities found through work
*   Inventions
*   Friends and relatives; co-worker relationships
*   Accepting gifts, entertainment, and other business courtesies
*   Use of AiDock products and services

In each of these situations, the rule is the same – if you are considering entering a business situation that creates a conflict of interest, don’t. If you are in a business situation that may create a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest, review the case with your manager. Finally, it’s essential to understand that as circumstances change, a position that previously didn’t present a conflict of interest may offer one.

1.  **Personal Investments**  
    Avoid making private investments in companies that are AiDock competitors or business partners when the investment might cause, or appear to cause, you to act in a way that could harm AiDock.  
    When determining whether a personal investment creates a conflict of interest, consider the relationship between the business of the outside company, AiDock’s business, and what you do at AiDock, including whether the company has a business relationship with AiDock that you can influence, and the extent to which the company competes with AiDock. You should also consider 1) any overlap between your specific role at AiDock and the company’s business, 2) the significance of the investment, including the size of the investment about your net worth, 3) whether the investment is in a public or private company, 4) your ownership percentage of the company, and 5) the extent to which the investment gives you the ability to manage and control the company.  
    Investments in venture capital or similar funds in a broad cross-section of companies that may include AiDock competitors or business partners generally do not create conflicts of interest. However, a conflict of interest may exist if you control the fund’s investment activity.
2.  **Outside Employment, Advisory Roles, Board Seats, and Starting Your Own Business**  
    Avoid accepting employment, advisory positions, or board seats with AiDock competitors or business partners when your judgment could be, or could appear to be, influenced in a way that could harm AiDock. Additionally, because board seats come with fiduciary obligations that can make them particularly tricky from a conflict of interest perspective, you should notify your manager before accepting a board seat with any outside company. AiDock board members and employees who are VP and above should also report to [Tomer Shamir](mailto:Tomer@aidock.net). Finally, do not start your own business if it will compete with AiDock.
3.  **Business Opportunities Found Through Work**  
    Business opportunities discovered through your work here belong first to AiDock, except as otherwise agreed to by AiDock.
4.  **Inventions**  
    Developing or helping to develop outside inventions that a) relate to AiDock’s existing or reasonably anticipated products and services, b) relate to your position at AiDock, or c) are developed using AiDock corporate resources may create conflicts of interest and be subject to the provisions of AiDock’s Confidential Information and other employment agreements. If you have questions about potential conflicts or intellectual property ownership involving an outside invention or other intellectual property, consult Tomer Shamir or Legal.
5.  **Personal Relationships at Work**  
    Certain relationships within AiDock may compromise or be seen to compromise your ability to perform your job responsibilities, may create uncomfortable or conflicting positions, and may raise issues of fairness, favoritism, or harassment. Therefore, be mindful of how your relationships within AiDock could impact or be perceived by others. Romantic, physical, or familial relationships are not permitted between an AiDock employee and another AiDock employee or member of the extended workforce where one individual can exercise authority or supervision over the other. This prohibition includes any situation where one person is in the reporting line of the other or, for example, a situation where one person is a project or a technical lead on a project on which the other person is working. 
6.  **Accepting Gifts, Entertainment, and Other Business Courtesies**  
    Accepting gifts, entertainment, and other business courtesy from AiDock’s competitor or business partner can easily create the appearance of a conflict of interest, especially if the value of the item is significant. Generally, acceptance of inexpensive “token” non-cash gifts is permissible. In addition, infrequent and moderate business meals and entertainment with clients and periodic invitations to attend local sporting events and celebratory meals with clients can be relevant aspects of many AiDock business relationships, provided that they aren’t excessive and don’t create the appearance of impropriety. Before accepting any gift or courtesy, consult Tomer Shamir, and be aware that you may need manager approval.  
    **Use of AiDock Products and Services**  
    Avoiding potential conflicts of interest also means that you should not use AiDock products, services, internal tools, or information in a way that improperly benefits you or someone you know or creates the appearance that you have an unfair advantage over users outside of AiDock. For example, you should never approve AiDock accounts, services, or credits for yourself, your friends, or your family. Similarly, you should not use the tools, information, or access you have as an AiDock employee to participate in or generate a financial benefit for yourself or others. If you find yourself subject to a conflict of interest regarding using AiDock’s products, services, tools, or information, discuss the situation with your manager, Legal, or Tomer Shamir.

## **Preserve Confidentiality**

We get a lot of press attention around our innovations and culture, which is usually fine. However, if leaked prematurely into the press or to competitors, certain kinds of company information can hurt our product launches, eliminate our competitive advantage and prove costly in other ways. Our responsibilities extend beyond not revealing Confidential AiDock material – we must also:

*   Properly secure, label, and (when appropriate) dispose of Confidential AiDock material;
*   Safeguard Confidential information that AiDock receives from others under non-disclosure agreements;
*   Please take steps to keep our trade secrets and other confidential intellectual property secrets.

1.  **Confidential Information**  
    : Ensure that information classified as “Need to Know” or “Confidential” in AiDock’s Data Classification Guidelines is handled by those Guidelines and AiDock’s Data Security Policy. At times, a particular project or negotiation may require you to disclose Need to Know or Confidential information to an outside party: Disclosure of that information should be on an “only as needed” basis and only under a non-disclosure agreement. In addition, AiDock policy may require a prior security assessment of the outside party to receive confidential information. Be sure to conduct the appropriate due diligence and have the formal agreement before you disclose the information.  
    There are, of course, “gray areas” in which you must apply your best judgment in making sure you don’t disclose confidential information.
2.  Suppose a friend who works at a non-profit organization asks you informally how to improve the AI results: Giving your friend AI-optimization tips available in public articles and on websites isn’t likely to be a problem, but giving directions that aren’t publicly known definitely would be. If you’re in a gray area, be cautious in what advice or insight you provide or, better yet, ask for guidance from [Tomer Shamir](mailto:Tomer@aidock.net).  
    And don’t forget about pictures you and your guests take at AiDock – ensuring those pictures don’t disclose confidential information is up to you.  
    Finally, some of us will have family or other personal relationships with people employed by our competitors or business partners. As in most cases, common sense applies. Don’t tell you’re significant other or family members anything confidential, and don’t solicit personal information about their company.
3.  **AiDock Partners**  
    Just as you are careful not to disclose confidential AiDock information, it’s equally important not to reveal any personal information from our partners. Don’t accept personal information from other companies without having all parties sign an appropriate Non-disclosure Agreement approved by Legal. Even after the agreement is signed, try only to get as much information as you need to accomplish your business objectives.
4.  **AiDock data**  
    Be sure to protect the confidential information of AiDock or any subsidiary or affiliate. You may have access to personal information through collaborations, rotations, 20% projects with another AiDock company, access to AiDock buildings or networks, or simply through casual interactions. Don’t access or use confidential information of other AiDock companies except when authorized and reasonably necessary for valid business purposes within your work at AiDock. Take all reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of any such information, just as you would for AiDock’s confidential information.  
    Don’t disclose any personal information about any AiDock company, including financial, partner, business, technical, or IP information, before obtaining appropriate sign-off from Legal, which may include getting consent from affected AiDock companies.
5.  **Competitors/Former Employers**  
    We respect our competitors and want to compete fairly. But we don’t like their confidential information. The same goes for personal information about any AiDock employee’s former employers. Don’t do it if an opportunity arises to exploit a competitor’s or former employer’s confidential information. If you happen to possess a competitor’s personal information, contact Legal immediately.
6.  **Outside Communications**  
    You probably know our policy is to be extremely careful about disclosing confidential, proprietary information. Consistent with that, you should also ensure your external communications (including online and social media posts) do not disclose personal, proprietary information or represent (or otherwise give the impression) that you are speaking on behalf of AiDock unless authorized by the company. The same applies to communications with the press. Finally, check with your manager and Corporate Communications before accepting any public speaking engagement on behalf of the company. Before making any external communication or disclosure, you should consult with your direct manager or [Tomer Shamir](mailto:Tomer@aidock.net).

## **Protect AiDock’s Assets**

AiDock has a well-earned reputation for generosity with our employee benefits and openness to confidential information shared within the company. Our ability to continue these practices depends on how well we conserve company resources and protect company assets and data.

1.  **Intellectual Property**  
    AiDock’s intellectual property rights (our trademarks, logos, copyrights, trade secrets, “know-how,” and patents) are among our most valuable assets. Unauthorized use can lead to their loss or severe loss of value. It would be best to respect all copyright and other intellectual property laws, including laws governing the fair use of copyrights, trademarks, and brands. You must never use AiDock’s (or its affiliated entities’) logos, marks, or other protected information or property for any business or commercial venture without pre-clearance from the legal or [Tomer Shamir](mailto:Tomer@aidock.net). We strongly encourage you to report any suspected misuse of trademarks, logos, or other AiDock intellectual property to Legal.  
    Likewise, respect the intellectual property rights of others. Inappropriate use of others’ intellectual property may expose AiDock and you to criminal and civil fines and penalties. Please seek advice from Legal before you solicit, accept, or use proprietary information from individuals outside the company or let them use or have access to AiDock proprietary information.
2.    
    Company Equipment  
    AiDock gives us the tools and equipment we need to do our jobs effectively but counts on us to be responsible and not wasteful with the AiDock stuff we are given. Nobody will complain if you snag an extra bagel on Friday morning, but company funds, equipment, and other physical assets are not to be requisitioned for purely personal use. You should also check with Legal if you are developing a product that uses content not belonging to AiDock. Not sure if a specific use of company assets is okay? Please ask your manager or [Tomer Shamir](mailto:tomer@aidock.net).
3.  **The Network**  
    AiDock’s communication facilities (which include both our network and the hardware that uses it, like computers and mobile devices) are a critical aspect of our company’s physical and intellectual property. Be sure to follow all security policies. If you have any reason to believe that our network security has been violated – for example, you lose your laptop or smartphone or think your network password may have been compromised – please promptly report the incident to [Tomer Shamir](mailto:Tomer@aidock.net). For more information, consult AiDock's Security Policy.
4.  **Physical Security**  
    If you’re not careful, people may steal your stuff. Always secure your laptop, necessary equipment, and personal belongings, even while on AiDock’s premises. Always wear your badge visibly while on site. Don’t tamper with or disable security and safety devices. If you see someone in a secure space without a badge, report that, and any other suspicious activity, to building Security. 
5.  **Use of AiDock’s Equipment and Facilities**  
    Anything you do use AiDock’s corporate electronic facilities (e.g., our computers, mobile devices, network, etc.) or store on our premises (e.g., letters, memos, and other documents) might be disclosed to people inside and outside the company. For example, AiDock may be required by law (e.g., in response to a subpoena or warrant) to monitor, access, and disclose the contents of corporate email, voicemail, computer files, and other materials on our electronic facilities or our premises. In addition, the company may monitor, access, and disclose employee communications and additional information on our corporate electronic facilities or on our premises where there is a business need to do so, such as protecting employees and users, maintaining the security of resources and property, or investigating suspected employee misconduct.
6.  **Employee Data**  
    We collect and store personal information from employees around the world. Access this data only in line with local law and AiDock internal policies. Be sure to handle employee data consistent with AiDock’s Data Classification and Employment Data Guidelines and other AiDock policies.

## **Ensure Financial Integrity and Responsibility**

Financial integrity and fiscal responsibility are core aspects of corporate professionalism. This is more than accurate reporting of our financials, though that’s undoubtedly important. The money we spend on behalf of AiDock is not ours; it’s the company’s and, ultimately, our shareholders. Each person at AiDock – not just those in Finance – ensures that money is appropriately spent, our financial records are complete and accurate, and internal controls are honored. This matters whenever we hire a new vendor, expense something to AiDock, sign a new business contract, or enter into any deals on AiDock’s behalf.

To ensure we get this right, AiDock maintains a system of internal controls to reinforce our compliance with legal, accounting, tax, and other regulatory requirements in every location we operate.

Stay in full compliance with our system of internal controls, and don’t hesitate to contact [Tomer Shamir](mailto:tomer@aidock.net) or Finance if you have any questions. Some core concepts lie at the foundation of financial integrity and fiscal responsibility here at AiDock.

1.  **Spending AiDock’s Money**  
    A core AiDock value has always been to spend money wisely. When you submit an expense for reimbursement or spend money on AiDock’s behalf, ensure the cost is reasonable, directly related to company business, and supported by appropriate documentation. Always record the business purpose (e.g., if you take someone out to dinner on AiDock, always record in our expense reimbursement tool the full names and titles of the people who attended and the reason for the dinner) and comply with other submission requirements. If you’re uncertain whether to spend money or submit an expense for reimbursement, check with your manager. Managers are responsible for all money spent and expenses incurred by their direct reports and should carefully review them before approving.
2.  **Signing a Contract**  
    Each time you enter into a business transaction on AiDock’s behalf, there should be documentation recording that agreement, approved by the Legal Department. Signing a contract on behalf of AiDock is a huge deal. Never sign any contract on behalf of AiDock unless all of the following are met:
    *   You are authorized to do so under our Signature Authority and Approval Policy. If you are still determining whether you are approved, ask your manager.
    *   Legal has approved the contract. If you are using an approved AiDock form contract, you don’t need further Legal approval unless you have made changes to the form contract or are using it for anything other than its intended purpose.
    *   You have studied the contract, understood its terms, and decided that agreeing is in AiDock’s interest.
3.  **All contracts** at AiDock should be in writing and contain all of the relevant terms to which the parties agree – AiDock does not permit “side agreements,” oral or written.
4.  **Recording Transactions**  
    If your job involves the financial recording of our transactions, ensure you’re thoroughly familiar with all of the AiDock policies that apply, including our Revenue Recognition Policy and our Purchasing Policy. Immediately report any transactions you think are not being recorded correctly to Finance.
5.  **Reporting Financial or Accounting Irregularities,**  
    It goes without saying (but we’re going to tell it anyway) that you should never interfere in any way with auditing AiDock’s financial records. Similarly, you should never falsify any document or account, including time reports, expense accounts, and other AiDock records.  
    If you suspect or observe any of the conduct mentioned above or, for that matter, any irregularities relating to financial integrity or fiscal responsibility, no matter how small, immediately report them to Tomer Shamir. Please familiarize yourself with our Reporting of Financial and Accounting Concerns Policy.
6.  **Hiring Suppliers**  
    As AiDock grows, we enter into more and more deals with suppliers of equipment and services. We should always strive for the best possible value for AiDock. This almost always requires that you solicit competing bids to ensure you’re getting the best offer. While price is significant, it isn’t the only factor worth considering. Quality, service, reliability, and the terms and conditions of the proposed deal may also affect the final decision. Please do not hesitate to contact Tomer Shamir with any questions about procuring equipment or services.
7.  **Retaining Records,**  
    we must keep records for an appropriate length of time. The AiDock Records Retention Policy suggests minimum record retention periods for specific documents. These are great guidelines, but remember that legal requirements, accounting rules, and other external sources sometimes specify more extended retention periods for certain types of records and those controls where applicable. In addition, if Legal asks to retain documents relevant to a litigation, audit, or investigation, do so until Legal tells you retention is no longer necessary. If you have any questions regarding the correct length of time to retain a record, contact Tomer Shamir.

## **Obey the Law**

AiDock takes its responsibilities to comply with laws and regulations very seriously, and we are expected to comply with applicable legal requirements and prohibitions. While it’s impossible for anyone to know all aspects of every applicable law, you should understand the significant laws and regulations that apply to your work. Take advantage of Legal and Ethics & Compliance to assist you here. If you are in any way involved in sending or making available AiDock products, services, software, equipment, or any form of technical data from one country to another, work with your manager to be sure that the transaction stays well within the bounds of applicable laws. If you or your manager are not sure, please get in touch with Tomer Shamir.

1.  **Competition Laws**  
    Most countries have laws – known as “antitrust,” “competition,” or “unfair competition” laws – designed to promote free and fair competition. Generally speaking, these laws prohibit 1) arrangements with competitors that restrain trade in some way, 2) abuse of intellectual property rights, and 3) use of market power to unfairly disadvantage competitors.  
    Certain conduct is prohibited under these laws and could result in your imprisonment, not to mention severe penalties for AiDock.  
    Examples of prohibited conduct include:
    *   Agreeing with competitors about prices
    *   Agreeing with competitors to rig bids or to allocate customers or markets
    *   Agreeing with competitors to boycott a supplier or customer
2.  Other activities can also be illegal, unfair, or create the appearance of impropriety. Such activities include:
    *   Sharing competitively sensitive information (e.g., prices, costs, market distribution, etc.) with competitors
    *   Entering into a business arrangement or pursuing a strategy with the sole purpose of harming a competitor
    *   Using AiDock’s size or strength to gain an unfair competitive advantage
3.  Although the spirit of these laws is straightforward, their application to particular situations can be complex.  
    AiDock is committed to competing fair and squarely, so don’t hesitate to contact Tomer Shamir if you have any questions about the antitrust laws and how they apply to you. If you suspect anyone at the company is violating the competition laws, notify Tomer Shamir immediately. Any personnel found to have violated AiDock’s Antitrust Policies will, subject to local regulations, be disciplined up to and including termination of employment.
4.  **Insider Trading Laws**  
    As we said earlier, internally, we share information, including non-public information, about AiDock’s business operations pretty freely. In addition, you may overhear a hallway conversation or come across a memo at a copy machine, which might involve confidential information. Using this non-public information to buy or sell a stock, or to pass it along to others so they may do so, could constitute insider trading. Insider trading not only violates this Code, but it also violates the law. Please don’t do it.  
    It would be best to familiarize yourself with AiDock’s Insider Trading Policy. It describes company-wide policies that address insider trading risks, such as a prohibition on any AiDock employee hedging AiDock stock; and periodic blackout windows when no AiDock employee may trade AiDock stock.
5.  **Anti-bribery Laws**  
    Like all businesses, AiDock is subject to many laws, both in Israel and outside its borders, that prohibit bribery in virtually every commercial setting. The rule for us at AiDock is simple – don’t bribe anybody, anytime, for any reason.
6.  **Non-government relationships**  
    You should be careful when you give gifts and pay for meals, entertainment, or other business courtesies on behalf of AiDock. We want to avoid the possibility that the gift, entertainment, or additional business courtesy could be perceived as a bribe, so it’s always best to provide such business courtesies infrequently and, when we do, to keep their value moderate. Consult AiDock’s CCSO before giving any business courtesies, and contact Tomer Shamir if you have any questions.
7.  **Dealing with government officials**  
    Offering gifts, entertainment, or other business courtesies that could be perceived as bribes becomes especially problematic if you’re dealing with a government official. “Government officials” include any government employee; candidate for public office; or employee of government-owned or -controlled companies, public international organizations, or political parties. Several laws worldwide, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act, expressly prohibit offering or giving anything of value to government officials to influence official action or to secure an improper advantage. This includes traditional gifts and things like meals, travel, political or charitable contributions, and job offers for government officials’ relatives. Never give gifts to thank government officials for doing their jobs. By contrast, it can be permissible to make infrequent and moderate expenditures for gifts and business entertainment for government officials that are directly tied to promoting our products or services (e.g., providing a modest meal at a day-long demonstration of AiDock products). Payment of such expenses can be acceptable (assuming they are permitted under local law). Still, it may require pre-approval from Ethics & Compliance under AiDock’s Anti-Bribery and Government Ethics Policy.  
    AiDock also has strict rules that severely limit the ability of a company or its employees to give gifts and business courtesies to a government official and also limit the official’s ability to accept such donations. The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act prohibits giving gifts, including travel and other courtesies, to Members, Officers, and government employees unless they fit within one of several specific exceptions. Contributions to government executive branch employees are also regulated and subject to limits.
8.  Finally, state and local government officials are also subject to additional legal restrictions. Consult AiDock’s Anti-Bribery and Government Ethics Policy before giving any such gifts or business courtesies and obtain all required pre-approvals. In sum, before offering assistance or business courtesies to a government official, you should consult AiDock’s Anti-Bribery and Government Ethics Policy.

## **Conclusion**

AiDock aspires to be a different kind of company. It’s impossible to spell out every possible ethical scenario we might face. Instead, we rely on one another’s good judgment to uphold a high standard of integrity for ourselves and our company. We expect all AiDock employees to be guided by the letter and the spirit of this Code. Sometimes, identifying the right thing to do isn’t an easy call. If you aren’t sure, don’t be afraid to ask questions of your manager, Legal or Ethics & Compliance.

And remember…if you see something you think isn’t right – speak up!
